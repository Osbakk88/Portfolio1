                  <p>
                    My name is Christina, and I'm a Front-End Development
                    student with a long background in healthcare. For many years
                    I worked closely with people, routines and complex systems —
                    and along the way I discovered how much I enjoy solving
                    problems, creating order and making things easier for
                    others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's what led me to front-end development. I love building
                    clean interfaces, working visually in Figma and bringing
                    designs to life with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I'm curious by nature, detail-oriented, and I enjoy learning
                    new tools — including using AI to improve workflows and code
                    quality. I'm now working toward becoming a full-fledged
                    front-end developer and building a portfolio that reflects
                    both my creativity and my dedication.

              <h2>My Journey</h2>
              <p>
                My journey into front-end development began with a growing
                curiosity for how digital solutions are built, and how good
                design can make information clearer and everyday tasks easier.
                Since starting my studies in January 2024, I've been steadily
                building my skills through hands-on projects, problem-solving
                and continuous learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                What motivates me most is the process of turning ideas into
                something visual and functional — from early sketches in Figma
                to structured HTML, styled layouts and interactive JavaScript.
                Every project teaches me something new, whether it's
                accessibility, clean structure, responsiveness or better
                workflow.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I progress through my studies, I'm focused on expanding both
                my technical skills and my ability to create intuitive,
                user-friendly experiences. This portfolio represents the
                beginning of that journey — and I'm excited for everything I'll
                continue to build and learn along the way.

            <div class="about-section">
              <h2>AI & Development</h2>
              <p>
                One of my passions is exploring how AI can enhance the
                development process. I'm fascinated by AI-assisted coding tools
                and how they can help developers write better code, solve
                problems more efficiently, and learn new concepts faster.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe that combining human creativity with AI capabilities
                opens up exciting possibilities for building innovative web
                solutions.

              <h2>Beyond Coding</h2>
              <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and
                spending time with my family and friends. I also love to travel
                and explore new places, which gives me fresh perspectives and
                inspiration for my work.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am passionate about technology and how it can be used to
                improve our lives. I am always looking for new challenges and
                opportunities to learn and grow, both personally and
                professionally.
